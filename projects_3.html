The product manager would
sync up with me to outline the solution. I would design what was discussed and send the
designs to the developers to build. This workflow caused a lot of problems and impacted the efficiency of the projects.
</p><h1>Low velocity and inconsistent quality due to a lack of communication</h1><h3>Projects would take longer than anticipated</h3><p>For many projects, developers had concerns about technical limitations and development effort. Since
the developers were not involved in the process until after the design was completed, this resulted
in needing to revisit the design, often multiple times. While this would result in a satisfactory design
eventually, they were problems that we could have avoided by communicating earlier in the process. This
back-and-forth became demanding on both designers and developers.
</p><h3>What was built was not always the same as the design</h3><p>Even when there were no development concerns, inconsistencies with the design would appear on released.
Some inconsistencies were fixed post-release, but many became a permanent part of the product.</p><p>During development, sometimes decisions will be made to cut details from the end product. A more collaborative
process would have allowed us to find alternative ways forward. The development team tries to communicate when
these decisions get made, but sometimes they are omitted due to time constraints or seemed minor at the time.
</p><h1>The solution: Increase communication and collaboration throughout the whole process</h1><h3>Development research</h3><p>After syncing up with the product manager about the problem, I would vet the problem with developers before
getting too deep into the solution to avoid unnecessary work. We would have a conversation about what is
currently possible to build and what needs to be part of a larger project. This allows me to create
well-informed designs, while the developers have a better sense of what they are required to build.
</p><h3>Design reviews with developers</h3><p>There are two design reviews that I have with the developers before they start building.  The first review
is to go through a high-level flow of the solution and confirms the solution is feasible, before getting
too far into the design. Another review happens after I create a detailed version of the mocks, where I
outline edge cases that can occur. These reviews are done to have a unified understanding before development
starts and prevents a lot of back-and-forths.
</p><h3>Design specs</h3><p>Before handing off designs for development, a design specification document is written to communicate all
particularities of the design to reduce ambiguities while building. This documentation helps foster better
communication between designers and developers. This resulted in the project process to become smoother.</p><p>By implementing these touch points during the process, this promoted a smoother process and fostered a
better understanding of what was being built.
